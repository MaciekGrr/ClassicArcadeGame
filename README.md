This repository is made from the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. As this is personal skill assessment I most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Description

Creating ClassicArcadeGame is a 4th project evaluated by Udacity's course FEND ( https://eu.udacity.com/courses/all)
This game project was made as a result of Udacity FrontEnd Course task, which checked JS knowledge of students.
It had some basic HTML and CSS styling and JS engine for rendering.
Based on engine.js and resources.js and images prepared for rendering a map, student job was to add object
oriented prototype functions. Instead of proposed .prototype functions (ES5) it was made with JS "classes" (ES6)   

Review rules:

[rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. 
Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or 
class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and 
class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 
1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
